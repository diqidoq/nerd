====

The "dream" of a modern server based data evaluation application combined with a web application interface. The new way of thinking about a web application builder. The future starts here. The old principles of default "websites" or "web content" is legacy. Bundling functionality and building extendable modulary is future.

### NERD roadmap and features

 + Not an enforced system, rather a system builder
 + MVC / DRY / OOP
 + unique data values and function singularity and consistency and pluggable modularity
 + uncoupled small and single reusable unique data, bundles or functions
 + workflow API, a relation technique but for existing functionality to create complex functionality bundles
 + Don't couple functions by coding a system! Only code the builder for building flexible systems without code!
 + smart function isolation to prevent other functions hindrance
 + readable self explanatory code!
 + code comments in documentation style to build docs from comments
 + data management first
 + unique reusable data value consistency
 + central data storage accessable from unlimited directions
 + never mix data management and data display
 + multidomain/multiaddress management and contextual separation methods
 + advanced permission system, levels, types, groups
 + multi language and data translation management
 + complex data relation flexibility by default, multidimensional relations
 + application first, presentation last
 + only a few abstraction layers, no tools for all appraoch
 + clean the street for speed 
 + data evaluation builder API
 + fiedable data input form API depending on data bundler API
 + fieldable data bundler API 
 + no mark up, no presentation or UI mixed with functionylity!
 + act like an EDV system which can render webpages  or UI, not upside down
 + plugin API to extend for different data display engines, theme engines, data evaluation methods
 + Embrace modern web technologies like node.js, rvm based local ruby and gems, sass, compass, jquery, singularitygs, breakpoint
 + Don't refuse proofen techniques only because they are legacy like php, python, perl, what works best
