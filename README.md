nerd
====

nerd is just an idea * a brainstorming paper * a "dream" of a modern, flexible and limitless modular server based data and evaluation bundler combined with a browser based interface behavior like a web application * this makes it possible to build limitless web services * web sites * social networks * pinboards * blogs * and even (like the name suggests) complex EDP systems "in the cloud" ( I hate that word) * old principles of static or pseudo-dynamic  "websites" or "web content" is legacy * bundling REAL modular functionality and building extendable method boilerplates, which can adapt * that's the way to go! 

The idea sounds unrealistic, yes, but funny enough thou, that many "systems" out there already have those approaches in them * but they suffer simply from ... ... ... being a "system"! *  which renders most of these goals obsolete * don't think of a system * think of being a system builder * that's the trick * don't think of providing "features" * provide the "methods" and smart "rules" to make it possible to build flexible bundled "features" and pack it in UI to use it without coding.

### NERD fantasy road map and possible "features" (better say "rules", since features are limitless)

 + Not an enforced system, rather a system builder
 + complex but understandable builder admin tools
 + MVC / DRY / OOP
 + force unique data values and function singularity, consistency
 + Never hard code, keep always pluggable modularity
 + uncoupled small and single reusable unique value bundles and functions
 + workflow API, a relation technique but for existing functionality to create complex functionality bundles
 + Don't couple functionality like coding a system! Only code the builder methods for building flexible systems without code!
 + smart function compatibility to prevent hindrance for new functions
 + Important: readable self explanatory code!
 + code comments in documentation style to build docs from comments
 + data management and evaluation first: and admin interface should be able to function like code!
 + unique reusable data value consistency (e.g.: address is not the same data table like names, names can have many addresses, a.s.o.)
 + never mix data management and data display, never! these are 2 different APIs
 + central data storage, accessible from unlimited directions
 + multi-domain / multi address management and contextual separation methods to let the base act like many bases
 + advanced permission system, levels, types, groups
 + multi language and data translation management
 + complex data relation flexibility by default, multidimensional relations
 + application first, presentation last
 + no abstraction layer mess, no mass compatibility to reach brighter audience
 + reach out with smart functionality and quality for the smart users! not with over-whole compatibility to reach all user by risking layer overload
 + clean the street for speed 
 + data evaluation builder API
 + field-able data input form API depending on data bundler API
 + field-able data bundler API 
 + no mark up in methods! no presentation structures mixed with functionality!
 + act like an EDP system which (also) can render webpages or browser based UI, not upside down
 + plugin API to extend for different data display engines, theme engines, data evaluation methods. Keep it open, clean, transparent and code familiar. NO NEW terminology concept to learn!
 + Embrace modern web technologies like node.js, rvm based local ruby and gems, sass, compass, jquery, singularitygs, breakpoint
 + make the whole idea adaptable. don't think of it as a encapsulated entity. think of it like learning code or sociable molecules
 + BUT! Don't refuse proofed techniques only because they feel like legacy. php, python, perl, what works best, they all have their very true reason to exist.
 + DON'T follow every new hype. Be smart. Watch. Learn. Adapt not too early and not too late...
